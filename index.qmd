Hi! I'm Dr Sam Passmore, and you have found my website!  

I am currently a Post-doctoral Research Fellow with the [Evolution of Cultural Diversity Initiative](https://evolutionofculturaldiversity.anu.edu.au/), within the [College of Asia and the Pacific](https://asiapacific.anu.edu.au/), at the [Australian National Univeristy (ANU)](https://www.anu.edu.au/).

I use quantitative approaches to research anthropological and linguistic questions surrounding kinship, usually through an evolutionary lens. 

This website contains [a short bio](about.qmd), [blog posts](posts.qmd), and [descriptions of my various research interests](projects.qmd).
