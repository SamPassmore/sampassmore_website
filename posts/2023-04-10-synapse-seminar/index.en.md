I gave a talk in the Evolution of Cultural Diversity seminar series "SYNAPSE". The talk is about my research on kinship terminology. I talk about the relationship of kinship terminology to social organisation, and the importance of controlling for interdependence between langauges when examining this relationship. I then introduce Kinbank, a database of over 1,200 kinship terminology, and show how we can use this database to examine the extent of global diversity through statistical pipelines. Finally, I breifly discuss the relationship between kinship terminology and behaviour that I examined through small experimental pardigm comparing between English and Hindi.
