### Current position

I currently work across two projects, both based within the [College of Asia and the Pacific](https://asiapacific.anu.edu.au/), at the [Australian National Univeristy (ANU)](https://www.anu.edu.au/). I am a Post-doctoral Research Fellow with the [Evolution of Cultural Diversity Initiative](https://evolutionofculturaldiversity.anu.edu.au/), and I am also Post-doctoral Research Fellow on the Pacific Creoles Project, working with the Australian Defence Science and Technology Group (DTSG). 

### Research focus

My research focuses on the application statistical inference and computational modelling to anthropological
or linguistic data and questions. I use data driven approaches to analyze data from the humanities, with a focus on building a quantitative understanding of diversity. I have used a range statistical approaches to do this, including phylogenetics, machine-learning, and autoregressive regression models. I am particularly interested in the relationship between statistics and their assumptions and how they relate to the mechanics of the real world. Generally, I take an evolutionary approach to my research, which could also be labelled as cultural evolution. 

Details of the projects I am currently working on can be seen in the [projects page](projects.qmd)
